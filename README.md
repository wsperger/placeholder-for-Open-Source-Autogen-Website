# Project Placeholder: Open Source Data Extraction and Knowledge Graph Storage

This project serves as a playground to explore exciting JavaScript concepts. The goal is to develop an open-source solution that enables anyone to extract data from various files and store this information in knowledge graphs that support vector operations.

## Potential Extensions:
- I might include sample Azure Functions code to demonstrate automation capabilities on Azure.
- Alternatively, I could develop this as a custom connector for Power Automate, depending on further assessment.

This is primarily a pet project to experiment with new ideas and technologies.
